About Diabetes
</h1>
<body>
What is Type 1 Diabetes? 
Type 1 Diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which your pancreas do not produce 
insulin which is a hormone in your body which is responsible to keep sugar levels under control. Insulin pushes the glucose produced by the food you eat to your cells  and convert it into energy. Without insulin, that sugar would be stuck in the body and no energy would be produced. Your sugar levels would start increasing in turn damaging other organs of your body.
<br><br>
How do people control their sugar levels with Type 1 Diabetes?
Research for Type 1 Diabetes has come a long way in the past few years. Five years ago, people with Type 1 Diabetes had to give themselves 4 needles a day, one to last them the entire day, and one with each meal. Now all they have to do is get a pump which has a cannula inserted to their body which delivers insulin automatically to the body. They also donâ€™t have to prick themselves to check their sugar levels anymore as they can have a sensor attached to their body which monitors their sugar levels 24/7.

What are all the objects in the game? <br>
Juice  <img width = "20" height ="20" src="images/juice.png"><br>
- The juice is used when your sugar levels go low in the body. It is used to bring it up as it is a fast-acting sugary liquid. <br>
Candy <img width = "20" height = "20" src="images/candy.png"><br> - Candy is also used for when your sugar goes drop and it is used because it is filled with sugar. 
<br>Dextrose tablets <img width="40" height="40" src="images/dextrosetablet.png"> <br>
- These are also used to bring sugar up when it is low as it is a tablet purely made of dextrose which is a simple sugar.<br>
Insulin  <img width = "50" height ="50" src="images/insulin.png"><br>
- Insulin is the best method of bringing your sugar down when it is high as it is the best at getting rid of excess sugar and controlling the sugar level, although too much can also result in a low.
